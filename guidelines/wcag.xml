            <p>A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the

            <p class="example">A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well

   </p>
   
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that
      reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower
      contrast levels.
   </p>
   
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing
      that may be done by a user.
   </p>
   
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined
      size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text
      fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%
      of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors
      would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
      relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.
      The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
      metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who
      have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.
   </p>
   
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major
      browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If
      a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would
      be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from
      the default sizes in a similar fashion.
   </p>
   
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large
      print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK
      languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those
      languages and the next larger standard large print size.
