         <h2>Important Information about Techniques</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for finding contact details
               in a consistent location across pages to make it easier for users to find it. The
               interactive item in the Web page is a link to the contact details page. The programmatic
               and visual location is consistent on each page in the set of web pages, when viewed
               within the same size viewport. Activating the link brings users to a Web page with
               contact details such as a phone number and/or email address.

               <h3>Example 1:  A link at the top of the page</h3>
               <p>An on-line job application asks for many types of information from the user, such
                  as their identification number, but they may have several and not know which one to
                  enter. They may need more information from someone that can answer their question
                  when the contextual help provided does not meet their needs. The (for example) sixth
                  link that the user reaches when tabbing through the page is titled "Contact Us". This
                  link is also visually in the same location on each page. Activating the link brings
                  the user to the contact details page. The contact details page has an email address
                  for a company representative or general information inbox which is then shared with
                  appropriate personnel.

               <h3>Example 2: A link in the footer region</h3>
               <p>A Web page’s footer region contains links repeated on every page in a set of web pages.
                  The visual and programmatic order are consistent when viewed in the same size display.
                  The (example) third link in the footer region is labeled visually and programmatically
                  “Contact Us.” A user activates the link and is brought to the contact details page.
                  The contact details page has an email address for a company representative or general
                  information inbox which is then shared with appropriate personnel.
