## Translator Notes

* [ ] The links to the WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference fail for technical reasons. This will be addressed before sending the document to W3C as an official Candidate Authorized Translation.
* [ ] The links to the WCAG 2.1 Understanding Documents fail for technical reasons. This will be addressed before sending the document to W3C as an official Candidate Authorized Translation.
* [ ] All WCAG 2.0 content that was available in German was carried over from the existing translation.
* [ ] New sections that are new translations have a thick border around them to be easily distinguishable from existing text.
* [ ] In addition, much of the [introductory section](https://outline-rocks.github.io/wcag/translations/WCAG21-de/#intro) has been updated. The section [“<span>Vergleich zu WCAG 2.0</span>”](https://outline-rocks.github.io/wcag/translations/WCAG21-de/#vergleich-zu-wcag-2-0) has been completely translated.
* [ ] The enumeration of the first section, Introduction, should start with “0.” but does not for technical reasons.  This will be addressed before sending the document to W3C as an official Candidate Authorized Translation.
* [ ] Several placeholders in the header area will be filled out at a later date as they are dependent on W3C’s translation process.
